<p>This is finally working, here is a sample output below, it's Elton John made up of eltons johns. :)<p>
<p>Still work to be done though, it's far from perfect but this was a great moment when it worked.</p>

<h1>Experimenting!</h1>
<p>Here I have altered the code to decide which image is most suitable based on either brightness, saturation or hue, each weilding very different results.</p>
<h2>Brightness (B&W)</h2>
<p>Here I used only black-white images of solid colours. only using greyscale images for the cells works far better and is much more soothing on the eye than the next 3 which use colour images.</p>
