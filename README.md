<h1>Processing sketches</h1>
<h1>:art:</h1>
<p>Here are some of my sketches done in processing, feel free to clone the source code and alter it yourself. I recommend playing with the settings on the flowfield, it's rather fun! :) </p>
<p>I am meaning to upload all of my sketches but these are just the ones from my new PC.</p>
